# Week 2

## Starting the week
This week you will study additional concepts that will help you improve your code, and learn about Django and Pype.

## Study materials
### Additional Python Resources
- Test driven development: [Training 20/20](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/training2020/Test+Driven+Development)
- Details about how to improve string formatting [PyFormat](https://pyformat.info/)
- Learn about Regex:
    * [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/) - Lessons on Regex
    * [RegExr](https://regexr.com/) - Tool for testing Regex
- Learn about Python decorators:
    * A good summary of what Python decorators are, how they can be used, and why they are useful on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/739654/how-to-make-a-chain-of-function-decorators/1594484#1594484)
    * [The Code Ship](https://www.thecodeship.com/patterns/guide-to-python-function-decorators/) - Guide to decorators

### Reading for exercise 7
- Learn about Django with the [Django Girls Tutorial](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)
- Read about [Testing in Django 1.11](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/testing/)
- Optional Django reading from [Training 20/20](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/training2020/Django)
- Learn about [PyPE](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/python/PyPE+Documentation) - a deployment interface and environment where code is executed once deployed. All python web projects at the University are deployed in PyPE. There is a ton of documentation for this tool. Start with:
    * [Getting Started](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/python/Getting+Started+with+PyPE)
    * [Managing Project Deployments](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/python/Managing+Project+Deployments)
    * There is also a high-level overview available on [Training 20/20](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/training2020/Managing+PyPE+Projects)
>	When developers checkout their first TRecs project and try to work on it locally, if it uses any of the external packages like tinyarms they will have to do the [Using packages in your VM](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/trecs/Artifactory+Packaging) step here before it will work.
- Read about the use of Virtual Machines at UT on [Training 20/20](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/training2020/Virtual+Machines)


## Deliverables
### Coding Exercise 4
Use decorators to improve your Hangman game from Exercise 3 in any way you wish.

### Coding Exercise 5
Check if your code is PEP8 compliant. You can either use [this package](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/), or if the editor you are using has some tool to check that, you can use it.

Fix any issues that it flags. There may be some that seem like they don't matter, but don't just ignore them. Discuss these with Matt so you can see what is and isn't important once you get into production.

### Coding Exercise 6
Add tests to your Hangman game.

You may notice that it's not the easiest thing to add tests after the fact, and that you may need to change your existing code to make it easier to test. This is good though, if your code is simple enough to test, it means it's likely easy to understand. In the future, you can consider using Test Driven Development as you are working to make it easier on yourself.
