# Week 2

## Starting the week
- [ ]

## Study materials
### Python Tips and Best practices
- Read links to information on accessibility, HTML, and PEP8 validation on the [Puffins Standards wiki page](https://wikis.utexas.edu/x/AbFbCQ)
- Read about test driven development on [Training 20/20](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/training2020/Test+Driven+Development)
- Details about how to improve string formatting [PyFormat](https://pyformat.info/)

## Deliverables
### Coding Exercise 4
Use decorators to improve your Hangman game from Exercise 3 in any way you wish.

### Coding Exercise 5
Check if your code is PEP8 compliant. You can either use [this package](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/), or if the editor you are using has some tool to check that, you can use it.

Fix any issues that it flags. There may be some that seem like they don't matter, but don't just ignore them. Discuss these with Matt so you can see what is and isn't important once you get into production.

### Coding Exercise 6
Add tests to your Hangman game.

You may notice that it's not the easiest thing to add tests after the fact, and that you may need to change your existing code to make it easier to test. This is good though, if your code is simple enough to test, it means it's likely easy to understand. In the future, you can consider using Test Driven Development as you are working to make it easier on yourself.

### Coding Exercise 7
This is an advanced challenge.

For this challenge, you need to create a class (object) that can be used to determine the weather. Make use of the requests library in python.

#### Part 1
Setup a class that returns the current weather for one location (doesn't matter if it's hardcoded at the moment). Display the following details, plus others you feel appropriate:
- Zip Code
- Temperature
- Condition

#### Part 2
Now make it so that a user has the option of getting information for either their current location, or an input location.

#### Part 3
Now that all of that is set up, make it so that a user can get weather info up to 3 days from now.

#### Bonus
If you're ahead of schedule, add tests to your code.
