# Week 1

## Starting the week
- [ ] Set up your machine
- [ ] Connect with your Mentor on IT Peer Group Slack
- [ ] Schedule recurring 30 minute meetings with your mentor once a week for 6 weeks

## Study materials
### GitHub use at UT
I believe you are all familiar with GitHub, but [this tutorial](https://github.austin.utexas.edu/asmp-delta/afraid-to-commit) will give you some insight into how the tool is used at UT.

### UT Web Development Best Practices
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript materials have been excluded from these training materials because all of you should already be familiar with those concepts. The readings here are optional, but know you should follow University validation practices whenever publishing a site.
- If you need to brush up on your HTML, CSS, or JavaScript skills, [HTML Dog](http://htmldog.com/) is a great resource.
- Validate your HTML before publishing: [W3C Markup Validation Service](http://validator.w3.org/)

### Intro to Python
During your first week, you'll work through the [Think Python](https://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/thinkcspy/index.html) Tutorial. Chapters 1 through 10 will prepare you for exercises 1 and 2 below. Complete the rest of the chapters before moving on to additional exercises.

### Additional Resources
If you're feeling stuck, or some of the material isn't working for you, try to find the same topic in another tutorial. Here are some solid options.
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/) If you like the free portion of this tutorial, we can provide a PDF copy of the full version.
- [Google's Python Tutorial](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/)
- [Code Club Python Tutorial](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/)
- The [Training 2020 program](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/training2020/7.+Python%3A+Syntax+and+Concepts) designed by RegIT follows a similar, but different timeline with different materials and has a lot more detailed instruction.

## Deliverables
### Coding Exercise 1 - Substrings
Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if
```python
s = 'azcbobobegghakl'
```
then your program should print
```
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh
```
In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if
```python
s = 'abcbcd'
```
then your program should print
```
Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
```
Once youâ€™ve tested your program to satisfaction, rewrite it as a function that takes s as an argument and returns a string, longest_string, which contains only the longest substring in alphabetical order (so abc instead of Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc)

### Coding Exercise 2 - Hangman
Design a single-player Hangman game using function(s).

### Coding Exercise 3 - Classy Hangman
Copy the Hangman game you created in Exercise 2 and convert it to use class(es) instead of function(s).

Add these features:
- Allow selection of # of players
- Allow players to set their names
- Allow setting the # of guesses allowed
- Use a file for selection of a random word

## Ending the week
- [ ] Schedule time with Matt to review your exercises
- [ ] Complete any recommended changes
- [ ] Get Matt's approval to move on to Week 2 materials
- [ ] Update the TRecs wiki any time you see gaps or errors in the content
