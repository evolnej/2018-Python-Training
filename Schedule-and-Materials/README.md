# Schedule and Materials

## Program Structure
UT has run an in-house Software Developer Training Program off and on since the 70s. The SDTP was initially designed to teach programmers Natural. The TRecs Python Program is loosely based on the most recent version of the SDTP, but excludes the Natural Programming portions. If you are interested in learning more about the traditional training program, you can view the materials currently in use by [RegIT](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/training2020/Trainee+Area) (Registrar's office IT).

Since the TRecs Python Program is the first of it's kind, the schedule below is based on estimates. We expect there to be variations in how fast each section is completed for each individual. If you complete the materials early, you may move on to the next set, but don't rush! Producing quality, readable code is more valuable than speed at this stage.
