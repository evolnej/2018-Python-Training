# Week 3

## Starting the week
This week you will design a system. Dolores will provide the requirements.

## Study materials
- Learn about the Agile process by watching [part 1](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/) and [part 2](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-2/) on Spotify Engineering Culture.
    * Note that these videos represent an ideal state, so expect the TRecs process to look a little different.
- Learn about databases and SQL with this Lynda video - [Intro to Oracle 12C](https://www.lynda.com/Oracle-tutorials/Welcome/513600/603290-4.html)
- Read about [UTX](https://github.austin.utexas.edu/fish/pype-tools-utx)
- Read about [TinyArms](https://github.austin.utexas.edu/fish/pype-tools-tinyarms3)
- Read about System Architecture and Usability:
    * [Training 20/20: System Architecture and Usability](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/training2020/System+Architecture+and+Usability)
    * [Nielsen Norman Group: Usability 101](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/)
- Bookmark the [UT Brand Web Guidelines](https://brand.utexas.edu/application/web-guidelines/)
- Read about [Flowcharting](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/training2020/Flowcharting%3A+Basic+Symbols) and see some [Examples](https://wikis.utexas.edu/display/training2020/Flowchart+Samples)

## Deliverables
- [ ] Start attending Puffin Squad Agile Ceremonies.
- [ ] Review the system requirements and ask questions if necessary.
- [ ] Create a flowchart that demonstrates how data will be collected and stored in your system.
- [ ] Create wireframes so that your client can visualize the pages you plan to build. These can be built using web tools or by just sketching on paper. Don't worry if you can't product exactly what you design, just get an idea of the fields that will be on the page and how they will function.

## Ending the week
- [ ] Have Dolores sign off on the system design.
