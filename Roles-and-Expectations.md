**Ask questions!** Don't get stuck. When you run in to a problem that Google can't solve, consult your peers, then Matt, then your mentor in that order.

**Help each other!** The goal is for all of you to successfully complete this training. There is no benefit to finishing early. It is more important that everyone work together to achieve the common goal.
