## Tips on how to be successful
**Ask questions!** [Don't get stuck](https://codewithoutrules.com/2016/12/08/how-not-to-get-stuck/). When you run in to a problem that Google can't solve, consult your peers, then Matt, then your mentor in that order.

**Help each other!** The goal is for all of you to successfully complete this training. There is no benefit to finishing early. It is more important that everyone work together to achieve the common goal.

**You are an expert!** See something wrong or outdated in the training repo or the TRecs Wiki? Fix it! You are the current expert on the materials you are reviewing. Demonstrate your confidence in what you have learned, and entire team will benefit from your efforts.
