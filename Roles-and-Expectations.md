## New Hire expectations
### Professionalism
- **Be respectful.** UT Employees should treat all people with respect. Be courteous, considerate, and sensitive to how your behavior or words affect others. Everyone you come in contact with may be a future team member, project leader, or client.
- **Be honest.** Be honest with yourself and others. It is important to recognize and admit when you do not know the answer to something. Being able to do this improves the chance that you can be advised as to where or how to find the answer. Ask for feedback frequently so you have an accurate assessment of how you are doing.
- **Be self-reliant and responsible.** You are responsible for your own training. Do not expect to have others think for you nor give you the answers. "They didn't tell me about it" is not an acceptable excuse. It is the your job to find out what is expected of you and to be proactive about doing it. This is an essential skill for systems analysts when dealing with clients and when working on a project team.
- **Use your resources.** Occasionally, you may experience interpersonal problems or difficulties with other people. The best approach in this situation is to work directly with the person for resolution. You should try to solve these problems independently. However, if that doesn't work, your manager and mentor are available to offer advice and help in order to help you resolve the situation.

### Attitude Toward Training
- **Take charge of your training.** Keep the lines of communication open and make sure you resolve any problems that arise. If you don't know how to resolve a problem, ask for help. In general good people to talk to include your mentor, the  manager, your trainer, or anyone on the team.
- **Treat your trainer like your supervisor.** He is your project leader and needs to be aware of where the project stands. Remember that it is not your trainer's responsibility to give you the answers. His job is to guide you in the right direction.
    - Bring a clean copy of your code to each meeting so that your trainer can review it. If you can let them know in advance that it's in QUAL for them to review, please do so.
- **Follow all instructions, both written and verbal.** Take good notes during meetings. Use these notes as a checklist for each exercise. Ask your trainer to confirm your checklist is complete and accurate after each meeting.
    - Keep track of the tasks that you have completed and show your trainer how you completed it, such as sharing your code.

### Time Management
- Show a sense of urgency to complete challenges on time or ahead of time. With production projects, there will be occasions where a project deadline is critical and cannot be missed.
- Create your own schedule for each challenge and review it with your analyst.
- Use the schedule as a checklist to ensure that you have completed all the tasks from each week. Make sure to review the schedule when you think you have completed the all the exercises to ensure that you have accomplished all the necessary tasks.
- Review your schedule regularly and ensure that your trainer and manager remain up-to-date with your progress throughout training.
- Your trainer needs to approve your exercises each week before progressing on to the exercises for the following week.

### Approach to the Exercises
- Read and learn the syntax of the code statements included in each exercise.
- Learn the correct terminology. You should strive to understand and use technical terms precisely and correctly while talking with other technical staff.
- Read and interpret the documentation for the languages you are working with.
- Actively experiment with statements while reading the documentation. Use the examples in the documentation or make up your own examples to test the concept.
- Write the code and debug it to the best of your ability before seeking help. Ask for help if you cannot solve the problem after you have consulted your manuals and attempted to debug on your own.
- Be ready to explain your code at code reviews. Be familiar enough with your code and the programming concepts to answer any questions that will be asked about why you coded sections in a particular way or high level questions on how things work.
- If you have a statement in your reading that you did not use, ask your trainer where it would have been appropriate to use it.
- TEST, TEST, AND THEN TEST AGAIN. You should always thoroughly test your code. You should try every possible way to break the code, ensuring that you have tested all data and navigational scenarios. Observe and learn from experienced analysts about their testing techniques. A program that STOWs and goes (runs) is not guaranteed to work correctly. Check that the results are correct and that the method is solid and efficient.

### Communication and Meetings
- Remember that it is your responsibility to keep the lines of communication open and resolve any problems that arise.
- Code reviews, demos, and other meetings should not be scheduled before 8:30 am, at 1:00 pm, or after 4:30 pm if at all possible. This is just a courtesy to the participants.
- Your manager, trainer, and mentor should be invited to your code reviews. Make sure that you do not schedule a conflict on anyone's calendar. You may ask if something can be rescheduled.
- Be respectful of your colleagues' time. Proofread and test your work before having your anyone review it.

## Tips on how to be successful
**Ask questions!** [Don't get stuck](https://codewithoutrules.com/2016/12/08/how-not-to-get-stuck/). When you run in to a problem that Google can't solve, consult your peers, then your trainer, then your mentor in that order.

**Help each other!** The goal is for all of you to successfully complete this training. There is no benefit to finishing early. It is more important that everyone work together to achieve the common goal.

**You are an expert!** See something wrong or outdated in the training repo or the TRecs Wiki? Fix it! You are the current expert on the materials you are reviewing. Demonstrate your confidence in what you have learned, and entire team will benefit from your efforts.

## Training & Probation policies
### Work Schedule
As Non-Exempt employees, you are expected to work no more than 40 hours per week. Overtime will not be approved.

You will likely find the material covered during training to be challenging and interesting and you may want to learn more about programming as a hobby outside of work time. You should feel free to pursue your interests outside of work, however, you must avoid working on the training challenges outside of the 40 hour work week. This policy is in place to protect you and the university, if you have questions about this please contact your manager.

Employees are expected to work Monday through Friday during the established core hours; any variations must be approved by your manager.

### Breaks and Lunch
You will have 2 fifteen minute breaks and an hour for lunch each day. You are required to take an hour lunch each day, preferably some time between 11:30 am and 1:30 pm. Any variations to this schedule need to be approved by your manager.

### Leave Time
Vacation time is accrued from your first day of employment but should not be spent until you have been here for 180 days. Exceptions to this policy are rare and only considered under extenuating circumstances.

You may use Sick Leave according to the university's sick leave policy. Note that when an absence from work caused by your own medical condition lasts longer than 3 days, a return to work certification is required and should be submitted to your manager.

### Supervision
All matters of time off (sick or emergency leave), scheduling, or any other issues relating to employment should be brought to your manager. You should submit your completed Time Sheets to your manager.

### Treat trainers and mentors as supervisors
Follow all instructions from trainers and mentors and treat them like a supervisor during your training. Work with your trainer and your mentor to find a communication schedule and method that works the best for each of them, and then use it! Also keep your manager informed of your progress.
