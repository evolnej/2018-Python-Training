# 2018 Python Training

## Welcome to Technology Resources!

During your first six weeks with us, you'll complete the training contained in this repository. Start by getting your machine set up, and review the roles and expectations document. You have time to complete your HR compliance modules, so feel free to spread them out.

-	- [Roles and Expectations](/Roles-and-Expectations.md) - Information about what to expect during your training.
